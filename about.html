						<h3>I am 22 and doing what I love.</h3>
						<p>I began my four years at St. Edward's University in the fall of 2013. I graduated in 2017 with a major in Catholic Studies and a minor in Music. During my time at the university, I participated in the university choir, where I had many opportunities to sing in Austin and around the globe. I also worked as a teaching assistant for the choir, where I gained valuable leadership experience. In my final year of college, I began to actively pursue my desire to become a personal trainer. I began studying to be certified and I was hired as a personal trainer for my university health program. As a trainer, I worked with multiple clients throughout the school semesters and helped them reach their fitness goals. I currently work at HEAT Bootcamp in addition to training, and I am looking forward to continuing to grow my knowledge and my love for fitness.</p>

								<h3>I like singing and taking photos.</h3>
								<p>While I am focused on my career, I have other hobbies that I enjoy doing in my spare time. Choir and singing has been a part of my life since I was a child - I always dreamed about become a famous musician (admittedly, I still do). I currently sing with my good friends at St. Theresa Catholic Church. I also <b>love</b> taking photos. Head on over to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/steltrafitness/">my instagram page</a> if you are interested.</p>

								<h3>Austin is my home.</h3>
								<p>I was born and raised in Austin, TX. I know all of the best places to eat, to relax, and to get coffee. If you're new to the area, don't hesitate to ask me where I recommend you grab a quick lunch (I'm going to tell you to go to P. Terry's ðŸ˜‰).</p>
